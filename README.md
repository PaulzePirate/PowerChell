# PowerChell

A proof-of-concept aimed at creating **a PowerShell console in C/C++**, with all the security features patched or disabled: Antimalware Scan Interface (AMSI), Script Block logging, Module logging, Transcription, Execution Policy, and Constrained Language Mode (CLM).

## Build

1. Open the solution file `PowerChell.sln` with Visual Studio (you must have the Windows SDK installed).
2. In the toolbar, select `RELEASE-EXE` if you want to build the executable (.exe) file, or `RELEASE-DLL` if you want to build the DLL. In both cases, the target configuration will be `x64` because this is the only supported platform.
3. In the top bar, click `Build > Build Solution` to build the project.

## Usage

### Open a PowerShell Console

You should be able to run the **executable** straight away:

```console
C:\Users\Dummy\Downloads>PowerChell.exe
Windows PowerChell
Copyright (C) Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.

PS C:\Users\Dummy\Downloads> $PSVersionTable

Name                           Value
----                           -----
PSVersion                      5.1.26100.2161
PSEdition                      Desktop
PSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0...}
BuildVersion                   10.0.26100.2161
CLRVersion                     4.0.30319.42000
WSManStackVersion              3.0
PSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3
SerializationVersion           1.1.0.1
```

As for the **DLL**, you can use the following command:

```batch
rundll32 PowerChell.dll,Start
```

In the command above, `Start` is the name of a dummy function. It exists only to prevent `rundll32` from complaining about not finding the entry point. You can very well specify any entry point you want. It will work as long as you don't close the error dialog.

### Execute a Command

You can also execute a PowerShell command like this:

```console
C:\Users\Dummy\Downloads>PowerChell.exe -c "$PSVersionTable"

+-----------------------------------+
| POWERSHELL STANDARD OUTPUT STREAM |
+-----------------------------------+

Name                           Value
----                           -----
PSVersion                      5.1.26100.3624
PSEdition                      Desktop
PSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0...}
BuildVersion                   10.0.26100.3624
CLRVersion                     4.0.30319.42000
WSManStackVersion              3.0
PSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3
SerializationVersion           1.1.0.1
```

This also works with the **DLL**, albeit less convient because you won't see the result:

```batch
rundll32 PowerChell.dll,Start -c "$PSVersionTable"
```

## Caveats

- If you open any of the source files and Visual Studio is screaming at you because it can't find the `mscorlib` stuff, that's expected. You need to build the solution at least once. It will generate the `mscorlib.tlh` file automatically.
- The code of the DLL will likely need to be adapted if you want it to work properly using DLL sideloading.
